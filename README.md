# 3rd Generation Profit Trailer Settings for ProfitTrailer 2+
SETTINGS ARE NOT AVAILABLE YET...THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER :)

A lot has changed and so that means there's a lot to learn. Our working group has been spending a lot of time taking a look at baseline PT 2.0 settings. We're also eagerly awaiting a PTMagic update so we can begin to tackle pairs that are in different situations.

We're looking at trading in different ways too: 5 minute candles, 1 hour candles, trading on intra-day volatility, tading on downtrends/uptrends, etc. With all of this, there's a lot of backtesting that has to be done. I plan on having my PT bot in test mode for a good week or so. This will allow me to see if the settings actually work. I don't want to put my own capital at risk and I'm certainly not going to put yours at risk.

Please hang in there. Hoping to have something by late April or Early march. Good things to come...
